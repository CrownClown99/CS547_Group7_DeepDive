# CS547 Group7 DeepDive: Most Lucrative Industries

**Group Members:** Haoming Sun, Tianhua Tao, Zhihao Xu, Tingrong Zhang

### Problem Statement

Though many factors influence oneâ€™s choice of industry, wages stand out as one of the most important. Is it possible to predict hourly wages for certain occupations in certain industries, and determine which will be the most lucrative in the future? This might prove especially useful to soon-to-be graduates of any discipline, or those looking to carry their skillset over to a different industry. Modern machine learning techniques such as deep learning has been proved to achieve remarkable successes in such problems. This project will use the RNN(Recurrent Neural Networks) to solve this problem.
